Multi-Device Holder
==================
[[中文说明](README_zh.md)]

A multi-device stand that can be mounted on a multi-port charger. It is customizable to hold multiple smartphones, tablets, power
banks, and other devices.

Custom Parameters:
```
baseWidth       = Base Length
baseDeep        = Base Depth
baseHeight      = Base Thickness
separatorWidth  = Separator Thickness
separatorLength   = Separator Width
separatorHeight = Separator Height
rechargerHeight = Recharger Height
rechargerWidth  = Recharger Width. Note that since "cuboid" refers to the external width, here it should be set as: actual charger
width + base thickness. It is recommended to leave sufficient space for this purpose.
```
